We had several merge conflicts and we had trouble with our API requests to render data to our application.

** SPRINT TWO **

Q. What went well?

Communication with teammates was better this week and we were able to achieve some funcitonal benchmarks.

Q. What didn't go well during this sprint?

We had to switch our API, which set us back a little bit. Our movie swiping feature similar to doggie speed dating took a little too long to modify.

Q. What should we change during the next sprint?

Finish up our functionality on our components and perhaps scrap some of our ideas to save time and make our app more complete and finished.

** SPRINT THREE **

Q. What went well?

We were able to connect the backend to our frontend. Finishing our search and profile editing functionality. We all worked hard to get everything completed for the presentation.

Q. What didn't go well during this sprint?

Changing our code from one API to our backend API didn't go as smoothly as anticipated, had some unforseen backend issues that made us think how we could have started the backend differently.

Q. If we were to continue working next week, what should we change during the next sprint?

We would like to implement some direct messaging and getting an option to see someone else's profile. Adding a 'watch list' to our application.
